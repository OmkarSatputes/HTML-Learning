        <h1>Omkar Satpute</h1>
    <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/omkar__satpute_/">Bombzzy</a></strong></em></p>
    <p>Iâ€™m from a small town in Maharashtra called Baramati. I graduated from IIT Madras completing my Dual Degree in Engineering Design in 2022. I am working at Ernst & Young as an executive in strategy and transactions. My role is primarily advisory, doing due diligence and coming up with solutions to problems that the client is facing. I am currently working on energy transformation for our client who wants to shift from conventional energy to solar power and increase revenue at various sites. The major highlight so far was a visit to client sites and interaction with officials from neighboring countries and stakeholders to identify roadblocks with respect to current operations.
